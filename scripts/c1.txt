EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

On the shadowy side of the building, WILLIE JAMES, JR., late 
forties, pulled back pony tail, cowboy boots, picks up pay 
phone. The wide open desert stretches for miles behind him. 

His dirty hands slide two dimes in. He holds a small picture 
in hand of him and his six year old girl with a butterfly 
necklace on her neck. 

Flips the picture over. Dials a number from the back. 

The line RINGS. 

               WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

               WILLIE

               JANIS (O.S.)

        Hello?

        Janis.

        Willie?

               WILLIE
        Hey. I'm bout halfway between 
        Abilene and Dallas.

               JANIS (O.S.)

        You out?

Willie eyes the picture of his daughter in his hand.

               WILLIE
        As of this mornin'. You forget? I 
        mean it's okay if you did. 

               JANIS (O.S.)
        Thought it was next month.

               WILLIE
        Thursdee. October fifteen. Today. 
        You'll still come tomorrow, though, 
        right? Like we said? Both of you?

Willie turns to face the open desert stretching for miles 
without a single person in sight.

               WILLIE (CONT’D)
        It'd be real good seein' Ava.

                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

               JANIS (O.S.)

        We'll see.

               WILLIE

        Janis? 

                                        2.

Willie shuts his eyes tight, irritated. He rubs his temple to 
relieve the pain from her all too familiar words.

               WILLIE (CONT’D)
        It'd be good to see you, too.    
        Last few years ain't been too 
        friendly. Like to put it behind us.

               JANIS (O.S.)
        You made it this way, Willie.

               WILLIE
        I really am sorry about everything.

               JANIS
        Wish I could believe you.

               WILLIE
        Not sure I can expect you to. But 
        it would just mean a lot to see 
        her. Both of you.

               JANIS

        Yeah-

Willie takes a deep breath, turns back to the wilderness.

               WILLIE
        You know I'd get down on hands and 
        knees if I thought you'd see it.
        People around me'd take me for a 
        fool, but I'd do it.

               JANIS (O.S.)
        You're between Abilene and Dallas. 
        No one out there to think you one.

               WILLIE
        'Cept this dog just walked on by. 
        Hate to look undignified to him.

She chuckles.

               JANIS (O.S.)
        Well, that hound is in good 
        company. Maybe you can lick each 
        other's wounds.

                                        3.

               WILLIE
        He no ordinary hound. He a racing 
        dog. Maybe I put money down on him 
        and that'd take care of everything.

               JANIS
        I'd say not much has changed.

               WILLIE
        Oh, don't be dramatic. You know I'm 
        just teasin'. Always am.

               JANIS
        Well, if you'd been a bit more 
        serious, we wouldn't be talking 
        over a pay-phone. 

Willie groans.

               WILLIE
        Look Janis-

               JANIS (O.S.)

        Willie-

               WILLIE
        Come on. It's been three years.

A long silence on the other end of the phone.

               WILLIE (CONT'D)
        Please. I never once asked you to 
        bring her to me cos I didn't want 
        her to see her father that way. And 
        neither did you. But now I'm out. 
        Now I am asking.

Janis exhales.

               JANIS (O.S.)
        I did tell you we would.

Willie grins.

In the distance the ENGINE of the greyhound MOTORS UP.

               WILLIE
        That's-that's good news. So I'll 
        just call you when I get there.

               JANIS

        Whatever.

                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

                                        4.

               WILLIE
        It will be good to see you, Janis. 
        I wasn't lying 'bout that.

               JANIS
        I'm sure Ava will be happy to see 
        you. Goodbye.

She hangs up. PHONE goes DEAD. Willie grips the phone tight, 
hesitates to hang it. Puts it on the hook. MONEY CLICKS. 

In distance along the desert road, a wilderness dog makes its 
way alongside the desert road. Willie sees it, smirks.
