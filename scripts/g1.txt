INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

As the Ghostbusters enter, people turn and stare at their strange
appearance.  They all wear matching blue futuristic jumpsuits with proton
packs strapped to their backs.  They also wear brushed-metal, flip-down
ecto-visors worn on the head like a welder's mask.  Knee and elbow pads
complete their strange outfits.

VENKMAN

He looks ill-at-ease and embarrassed by their outlandish getups as the
HOTEL MANAGER descends on them accompanied by a Slavic MAINTENANCE MAN and
a worried BELL CAPTAIN.

						MANAGER
				(agitated)
			Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests
			are starting to ask questions and I'm running
			out of excuses.

						STANTZ
			Has this ever happened before?

						MANAGER
			Well, most of the original staff knows about
			the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I
			mean ... But it's been quiet for years ...
			Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever
			this bad, though.

						STANTZ
			Did you ever report it to anyone?

						MANAGER
			Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to
			even talk about it.  I hoped we could take
			care of this quietly tonight.

						STANTZ
			Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind
			of thing all the time.

They cross the lobby to the elevators, attracting lots of curious interest
from the hotel guests.

VENKMAN

A GUEST accosts him while they wait for an elevator.

						GUEST
			What are you supposed to be?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  We're ... uh ... the exterminators.
			Somebody saw a cockroach on the twelfth floor.

The Guest looks at Venkman, noting the heavy proton pack on his back, the
odd-looking particle thrower and flipdown ecto-visor.

						GUEST
			That's gotta be some cockroach,

						VENKMAN
			Well, you can't be too careful with those
			babies.

The elevator arrives and he gets on with the others.
